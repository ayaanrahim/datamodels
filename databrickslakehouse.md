A dimensional data model is used primarily for storing data in a Data
Warehouse. It contains two types of tables, fact tables and dimensional tables.
A fact table contains numeric information, while a dimensional table contains
words to describe objects in a fact table. The dimensional data model differs
from the other models (hierarchal, network, relational) because of it's
structure as well as it's use case. The other models store current data, while
dimensional data models are mainly used to store historical data.
